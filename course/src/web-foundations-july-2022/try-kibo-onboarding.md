## Sign up for a live class

You must attend live class once a week on Zoom. This is one of the most loved parts of the program! You get a chance to solve problems and learn with amazing instructors. **Please select the time that works for you below then click the link to register.**

📢 You should **only sign up for one class!** If you select a class and it says that “event is sold out,” that class has filled up and you should pick another one.

🗓️ Each class takes place on Thursday, and is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. The class dates are **Thursday July 14th**, **Thursday July 21st**, **Thursday July 28th**, and **Thursday August 4th**.
