# Project: Rest of World Landing Page

**Due date: Sunday, July 31**

<aside>

👥 This is a team project. Find a teammate (or two teammates, for a maximum of three students per team) from your squad, and schedule time to work on the project together.

</aside>

If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-web** channel in Discord. You can work with anyone, you are not restricted to your squad. You are also allowed to work on your own, but it’s good practice to work together.

You can work together by sharing your screen, or by creating a new replit and sharing the join link with your teammate. You should each submit a copy of the project, but it can be copied from your teammate’s version (**which you all created together**!).


## Landing Page Styling

This project will stretch your Web Design skills. You’ll work to recreate the awesome landing page from [restofworld.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220428094707/http://restofworld.org/).

[**Access** and **submit** the project in Replit here](https://replit.com/team/web-foundations-july-2022/Recreate-the-Rest-Of-World-Homepage)

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions tab in Replit
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord
