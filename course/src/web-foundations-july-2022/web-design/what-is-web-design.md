# What is web design

*Estimated time: 30 minutes*

---

In week 1, you learned the basics of CSS. So you already know:

- CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the page
- To use `link` to connect CSS to an HTML page, like `<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />`
- CSS selectors like `p`, `.details`, or `#title` select the elements to apply a style
- Basic CSS properties like `color`

**But the sites you made in Week 1 were not pretty!** 

It’s not enough to apply just any styles. You have to know *which styles to apply* to make your site look... actually good.

## Noticing

Getting a site to look good starts with noticing what doesn’t look right. Then, you can make large or small changes to the design to fix it.

You’ve visited tons of websites in your life, and you’ve noticed that some sites look good, and others look bad. Now, you’ll need to hone this skill. You will learn to tell *why* some sites look good and others look bad.

## Practice: Noticing

👀 [Can’t Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/) is a game to help you practice **noticing** designs that are right and wrong.

1. Go to [Can’t Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)
2. For each level, click on the better design
3. Try to get through at least all of the Easy levels.

**Once you are done playing, consider the following reflection questions**

- Were some design mistakes easier or harder to notice?
- Do you think you could spot the mistakes without the comparison image?

## What makes a site look good?

Everyone has different taste, so there’s no universal “best” style. All the same, some sites look good and others don’t. Usually, what makes sites look good is a combination of just a few characteristics:

- Text Styling
- Spacing
- Layout
- Colors

CSS has tools for styling each of these. We’ll focus on some of these in the next lessons.
