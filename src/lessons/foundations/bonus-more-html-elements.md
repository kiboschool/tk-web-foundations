# More HTML Elements

<aside>

üòÉ This is a bonus section on other HTML tags.

You don‚Äôt need to know these, but they‚Äôre pretty cool if you have extra time!

## Other elements and tags

As you learn more web development, you‚Äôll see tons of other tags.

Here‚Äôs a preview of some of the tags you‚Äôll encounter. Again - you don‚Äôt need to know these ones. Remember that you can look them up later!

### Stylized text elements

There are lots of elements for particular kinds of styled text.

Here‚Äôs some of the tags, but without examples. Don‚Äôt try to memorize them. Instead, skim them, and then remember that you can always go back and look up the right element to use for a particular situation.

<details>
<summary>
<strong>List: stylized text elements</strong>
</summary>

- `<code>`: used to style blocks of code.
- `<pre>`: used for text that has been pre-formatted, like a poem, where the spaces are already there. Otherwise, spaces, tabs, and newlines all get collapsed by the browser.
- `<small>`: Small text
- `<u>`: Underlined text
- `<i>`: Italicized text
- `<s>`: Text with a strikethrough, like ~~this~~
- `<q>`: ‚Äúquoted text that fits within a line‚Äù
- `<blockquote>`: A block quote, usually multiple lines
- `<mark>`: Highlighted text
- `<del>`, `<ins>`: Text that‚Äôs been deleted or inserted
- `<sub>`, `<sup>`: Subscript ($_{subscript}$) and Superscript ($^{superscript}$)

</details>

### Semantic elements

**Semantics**¬†refers to the¬†*meaning*¬†of a piece of code. It‚Äôs about "*what purpose or role does that HTML element have*", rather than "*what does it look like?"*.

> When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?‚Äù
>
> *MDN*

HTML elements mean something. A `<p>` isn‚Äôt just styled like a paragraph, it tells other programs that the text inside *really is* a paragraph.

There are lots of kinds of ‚Äúthings‚Äù that go on webpages. For many of them, there‚Äôs a matching HTML element. Here‚Äôs some examples (there‚Äôs more than 100!)

Questions to explore:

- Why use Semantic HTML?
- What are the benefits of Semantic Elements?
- When would you use these?

### `<div>`, `<span>`: Generic Elements

Sometimes, you don‚Äôt know which semantic element to use. `<div>` stands for ‚Äúdivision‚Äù and it‚Äôs a generic block of HTML. `<span>` is a generic ‚Äúspan‚Äù of text characters, inline with some other text. If you don‚Äôt know another element that‚Äôs more appropriate, you can use one of these instead.

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="ZExGgPV" data-user="rrcobb" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rrcobb/pen/ZExGgPV">

### Structure and Page Information

When you create an HTML project, your editor might suggest a bunch of default starter HTML in `index.html`. You will usually not need to write these tags yourself, but here‚Äôs what they mean in case you were curious.

<details>
<summary>
    <strong>List: Structure and Page Information tags</strong>
</summary>

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` isn‚Äôt actually an element. It goes at the top of a file to say that it‚Äôs HTML.
- `<html>` is the ‚Äòroot element‚Äô of an HTML document. All of the other elements should be inside it.
- `<body>` is where all the page content should go - everything you see on the page.
- `<head>` is hidden metadata. It‚Äôs data about the webpage that doesn‚Äôt show up on the screen.
- `<title>` is the title of the page. It‚Äôs what shows in search results and in the browser tab.
- `<meta>` is for various other metadata about the page. There‚Äôs lots of types, which you can [read about on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta).
