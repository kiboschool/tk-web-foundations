# Project: Your ‚ÄúCS Professor‚Äù Page

<!-- COURSE START TODO: Update Due Date -->
**Due date: Sunday, February 19**

<aside>

**üë• This is a team project.**

<!-- TODO: ensure replit project is a group project -->

Find a teammate (or two teammates, for a maximum of three students per team)
and schedule time to work on the project together.

If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-web** channel in Discord. You can work as a team or on your own, but working together is good practice for being on a professional team of developers.

You can work together by sharing your screen, or by creating a new replit and sharing the join link with your teammate. You should each submit a copy of the project, but it can be copied from your teammate‚Äôs version (**which you all created together**!).
