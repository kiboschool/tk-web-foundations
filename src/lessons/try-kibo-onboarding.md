## Sign up for a live class
**Live class**: This is a mandatory class which happens once a week on Zoom. This is one of the most loved parts of the program! You get a chance to solve problems and learn with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-jameson/"> Trevor Jameson </a> who will be your instructor. Live classes take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays from weeks 1 - 4 in the program, and will be 1 hour and 30 minutes long.


**Select your preferred live class time by clicking on the link to register.**

üì¢ You should **only sign up for one class!** If you select a class and it says that ‚Äúevent is sold out,‚Äù that class has filled up and you should pick another one.

## Join Discord and introduce yourself

Discord is our community messaging platform. It's where you will get daily announcements, get help from instructors, attend office hours, and learn together with your classmates. Once the program starts, all communication from the Kibo team will be through Discord, so joining is mandatory.

### Join Kibo School server
1. If you already have a Discord account, [login in to Discord](https://discord.com/login). If not, [create a Discord account](https://discord.com/register?redirect_to=%2Flogin) then check your email inbox to verify your account. Be sure to check your spam folder if you don't see the email from Discord.
2. Click here to join the Kibo School Discord server: **[https://discord.gg/UU6v6F2bMe](https://discord.gg/UU6v6F2bMe).**
