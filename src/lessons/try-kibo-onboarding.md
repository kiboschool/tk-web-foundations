<aside>

üõ†Ô∏è During Try Kibo, you will write your code and submit in Replit. It has everything you need to build and run computer programs in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

</aside>

You have already created a Replit account during the admissions challenge. Now, you need to join the Replit team so you will be able to access your work in class. To prepare to use Replit in class:

1. Go to [replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Select "Log in" at the top right corner to login to your account
3. [Click this link](https://replit.com/teams/join/xicwltqhixbewobhqignpuisvpkjmhqt-tk10-wf) to join the Replit team for the class.

## Join Discord, introduce yourself, and submit the checklist form

Discord is our community platform. It's where you will communicate and connect with your peers and instructors. Once the program starts, all communication from the Kibo team will be through Discord, so joining is mandatory.

Here are the things that you must do as soon as you join Discord:
- Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel
  - Your full name
  - Your location
  - A fun fact about you
  - An image or gif that represents you
- Update your Discord profile with your first name and last initial e.g., "Labake A", "Sydney W"
- Submit the onboarding checklist form -- you will not receive an invite to orientation if you don't submit this form

### Now, join the Try Kibo Discord server and do the above

- If you already have a Discord account, [log in](https://discord.com/login). Otherwise, create an account and verify it via email. Check your spam folder if the email is not in your inbox
- Join the Kibo School Discord server: **[https://discord.gg/tptRNh8V](https://discord.gg/tptRNh8V).**
- As you join the discord server, follow the steps until you submit the onboarding checklist


We‚Äôre excited to see you at Orientation! Only those who submit the checklist form on or before **3p.m. GMT. Thursday, October 26** will get an invite to the mandatory orientation.

### Orientation date: Friday, 27th October from 3 - 5:30pm GMT. Mark your calendar
