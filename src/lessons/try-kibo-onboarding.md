## Join Discord and introduce yourself

Discord is our community platform. It's where you will communicate and connect with your peers and instructors. Once the program starts, all communication from the Kibo team will be through Discord, so joining is mandatory.

Here are the steps to get set up on Discord:

### 1. Find your Squad
You will learn with a smaller group of peers during Try Kibo. This group is your squad. Enter your email(the same email where we sent this message) to find out what squad you are in. Take note of your squad number and program - you will be asked when you join Discord.

[EMBED AT Interface]

### 2. Join Try Kibo discord server
- If you already have a Discord account, [log in to Discord](https://discord.com/login). Otherwise, create a Discord account then check your email to verify your account. Be sure to check your spam folder if you don't see the email
- Click here to join the Kibo School Discord server: **[https://discord.gg/52vqK7ZYaJ](https://discord.gg/52vqK7ZYaJ).**
- As you join the discord server, you will get a prompt asking what class and squad you are in. You should already know this if you have done the above. Select the appropriate options and click ‚Äúfinish‚Äù


### 3. Update your Discord profile
- Click on your username in the right sidebar, then click the pencil icon to edit your profile
- Select ‚ÄúEdit Server Profile"
- Update your server name to your first name and last name initial (e.g., Mercy W, Keno O). This will change your nickname in the Kibo School server only.

- Your full name
- Your location(city/country)
- A fun fact about you
- An image or gif that represents you!

**TIP:** Post your text message first, then post your gif/image as a separate message afterward.

### [optional] Customize the rest of your Discord profile
