# Bonus: More about DNS

You don't need to know this to publish your site, but in case you were curious about DNS, here's more info.

## DNS Records

In the lesson on domains and hosting, you learned what DNS is for. Now let‚Äôs talk a about what it actually looks like! The graphic showed the record like this:

![Untitled](./domains-and-hosting/untitled-2.png)

At its heart, DNS is really simple: it matches a name and a value. In this case, the name `kibo.school` is matched with the value `162.159.135.42`

The actual DNS record looks like this:

```txt
kibo.school.		3600	IN	A	162.159.135.42
```

This says that `kibo.school` points to `162.159.135.42`. It‚Äôs also got some extra info:

- There‚Äôs an extra `.` after `kibo.school`
- There‚Äôs a **TTL** of `3600`
- It‚Äôs an `IN` search
- It‚Äôs an `A` record

The extra dot means that it‚Äôs an *absolute* domain name. You can basically ignore this. (If it bugs you, you can read an explanation [here](http://www.dns-sd.org/trailingdotsindomainnames.html).)

**TTL** stands for ‚Äútime to live‚Äù. It says how long a DNS server should keep a copy of this record before it checks again. If it‚Äôs shorter, updates to the DNS record will show up faster, but the website might load slower.

`A` is the *type* of record.

`IN` is for INternet. All DNS records are `IN`.

### Types of DNS Records

There are lots of different types of DNS records. Different types tell different kinds of information, like:

- `MX` records: The email server is located at this address
- `CNAME` records: This name points to a different name (instead of an IP address)

`A` records match a domain name to an IP address. For matching the domain `[kibo.school](http://kibo.school)` to the address `162.159.135.42`, we use an `A` record.

As noted in the video, IP addresses like `162.159.135.42` are version 4 addresses. `AAAA` records are for IP version 6.
