## Publish and share a site

Instead of focusing on building from scratch, this project asks you to polish a previous project, publish it, and share it.

<aside>

- Find one of your prior projects
    - You can pick any project or exercise
    - It could be from the live classes, exercises, projects, or your own creation
    - Your final project or profile page might be a good choice
- Publish your site
    - We recommend you use Github Pages
    - If you want, set up a custom domain for your site
- Make that project even better
    - Test it, get feedback, and make improvements
    - Add `<title>` and `<meta>` tags to give it cool link previews
    - Add a favicon
    - Write a Readme file
- Share your site
    - Send the link in Discord to share with the Kibo Community
    - Share the link with friends, family, or classmates, to show off what you’ve learned

</aside>

There isn’t a separate repo for you to start or submit this project. We’ll see your work when you share it in Discord!
