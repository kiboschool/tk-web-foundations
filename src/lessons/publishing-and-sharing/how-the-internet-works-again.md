# How the internet works (again)

You‚Äôve explored how HTML, CSS, and JS come together to make the features on a webpage. Now, let‚Äôs take a step back to talk again about how the web works. That way, you can publish websites and share your projects with friends, family, and (maybe) with strangers!

# How the Web Works

Our picture of how the web works so far is like this:

- Your browser asks the server for a webpage
- The server sends back HTML, CSS, and JS files (plus images, videos, and other files)
- The browser puts those files together to make the webpage

## What‚Äôs missing?

There‚Äôs a lot that this picture leaves out.

- **Domain Names**: how does your browser take a URL like [kibo.school](http://kibo.school) and find the address of the server to ask for the files?
- **Backend Software**: how does the server actually send the files back?
- **Hardware**: things like wires, wifi, routers, and cell towers
- **Packets**: how do the server and browser actually send the files? What happens if parts of the files don‚Äôt make it?
- **Search**: how does Google know about all the web pages? How does it know which pages to show you when you search?
- **Security and Privacy**: how do browsers and servers use encryption to protect your information?
- And lots more!

This week, we‚Äôll focus on Domain Names, since that‚Äôs what you need to know about to publish and share your site.

## Draw the Internet: Revisited

<aside>

‚úèÔ∏è Remember in Week 1, when you drew a picture of the internet?

Find your drawing, and add a comment about it.

- If you didn‚Äôt draw one, add one now!
- Does the drawing still make sense?
- What changes would you make?

Look at the other drawings. Add a comment on one you find helpful!
