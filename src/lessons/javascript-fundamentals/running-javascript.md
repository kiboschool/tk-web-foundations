## Running JavaScript Code

Javascript is a language that can be "spoken" by many different computers and web tools. We will use 4 different tools to run Javascript in this course, but the rules of the language will always remain the same. The tools we will be using are:
- `<script>` elements inside of an HTML file
- [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/)
- Devtools Console
- [PythonTutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit)

### Script Element
In Week 1, we learned how to link a JavaScript file to our HTML web page with the `<script src="index.js"></script>` element. When building "real-world" web applications, that is the default way to run your JavaScript code.

### CodePen
For weekly projects and practice problems, we will use [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/), to run HTML, CSS, and Javascript together in the same webpage.

### Devtools Console
To run small snippets of code, we will use the DevTools Console. It is useful for learning and testing small snippets ofJavaScript, usually between 1 - 5 lines long.

### PythonTutor
An excellent learning tool to visualize what changes happen at each step of our Javascript code is [PythonTutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit). In the coming lessons, we'll be using this interactive tool to run our code and visualize what happens in Javascript's "mind" while each step of the code runs.
