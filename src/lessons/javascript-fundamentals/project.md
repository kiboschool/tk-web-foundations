# Project: Content Gallery

<aside>

üë• **This is a team project**. Find teammates in Discord, communicate with them,
then join the Github team together and schedule time to work on the project.


If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the
help channel in Discord.

You can work with anyone, you are not restricted to your squad. You are also
allowed to work on your own, but it‚Äôs good practice to work together.

You can work together by sharing your screen, or by creating a new project in
Replit and sharing the join link with your teammate. You should be sure that
both of your names are linked to the submission in Github and Gradescope.
