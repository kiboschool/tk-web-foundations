# Publishing and Sharing

Now that you can make websites, you need to be able to publish them and share them! That's what these lessons are about.

> This content is _optional_. We think it's cool to be able to publish your site online, but you can come back to it later.

## Learning Objectives

You'll learn to:

- Publish your website using Github Pages
- Use HTML tags to control the preview when you share the link to your site
- Set up a domain name, so that your site shows up when someone types in the URL, like [devtools.programming.africa](https://devtools.programming.africa/)
