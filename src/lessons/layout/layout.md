# Layout

With the Box Model, you can control the size and spacing in and around elements. But, the box model doesnâ€™t let you position elements anywhere you want.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn about laying out the elements on the page.

> ðŸš§ Layout can be time-consuming and difficult. Be patient!

## CSS Layout

Layout means controlling the arrangement of the elements on the page.

Itâ€™s challenging because it involves the interactions between lots of different properties: the sizes of the elements (per the Box Model), their nesting relationships with each other, and lots of other CSS properties.

We wonâ€™t cover every detail about layout in this lesson. Weâ€™ll focus on three key concepts:

- Understanding Normal Flow
- The `display` property
- Flexbox

There are tons more things to learn about layout, but with these four concepts, you should be able to achieve most layouts you want.

- Float
- Table layout
- Multi-column layout
- Responsive design and media queries

The `display` property controls how each element gets treated in the flow.

- Is it treated as _block_ or _inline_? (the **outside** display)
- How do elements flow **inside** the element? (the **inside** display)

First we'll talk more about block and inline elements, then we'll talk more
about another kind of flow called _flexbox_.

### Block and Inline

**Block** elements get line breaks before and after the element, so they show up on their own line. You can set `display: block;` to make an element act as a block.

Elements like `<p>`, `<div>`, `<h2>`, and `<section>` all have `display: block;` automatically, so you donâ€™t need to set it.

**Inline** elements donâ€™t get line breaks, so show up inline with other elements.

You can set elements to `display: inline;` to force them to show inline with other elements.

Elements like `<a>`, `<em>`, and `<strong>` automatically have `display: inline;`, so you donâ€™t need to set it yourself.

**Inline Block** elements are a mix of both. `display: inline-block` makes the
element show up inline, but take up space like a block.

## Practice: Block and Inline

ðŸ“º Practice using the `display` property and your new understanding of inline and block elements.

## Other `display` values

### `display: none;`

`none` is a special display value that hides content.

This is particularly useful if you want to hide something, like if it should only appear when a button is clicked.

### `display: flex;`

This turns the contents into a _Flexbox_.

You'll learn about Flexbox in another lesson.

### `display: grid;`

This turns the contents into a _Grid_.

You'll learn about Grid in another lesson.

<details>
<summary><strong>Normal Flow</strong></summary>

**Normal flow** is how elements are laid out on the page by default.

![Normal flow. Elements are 100% width and stack on each other.](layout/normal-flow.png)

In Normal Flow, block elements stack on top of each other, each on its own line.

- **Block elements** fill up 100% of the available width. Usually, thatâ€™s the width of the screen. They are as tall as their content.

- **Inline elements**, like links and spans, are laid out inside the block elements, and donâ€™t go on new lines.

When you learn about Flex and Grid, those are _alternate flow modes_. Elements will no longer follow the normal flow rules.

<details>
<summary><strong>Inside Display</strong></summary>

So far, weâ€™ve only talked about _Normal flow_, using block and inline elements.
There are other flow modes that make creating certain layouts much easier.

When you set `display` to other values, you change how the elements
**inside** that element get displayed. Instead of Normal flow, they use other
layout rules.

The only other flow mode weâ€™re going to explore in depth is `flex`. You might
come across grid and table layouts.

The [MDN reference on the CSS display property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) lists comprehensive information about what the possible display values are. You can get by without knowing most of them, but the possible inside display values are `flow`, `flow-root`, `table`, `flex`, `grid`, and `ruby`.
