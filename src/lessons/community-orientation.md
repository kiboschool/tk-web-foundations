## Challenge 2: Build Team Info Pageüë©üèæ‚Äçüíª

> **Description:** In this challenge, you will build a site in Replit with info about your team. Every team member should still be on the Squad voice channel


1. Your scribe should share their screen
2. While sharing screen, the team scribe should go to the replit team for the Future Proof with Python class, and create a replit group for today's challenge

Watch the video below to see how to do this. 
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/b51f9cf1ca9c4dcf9994a20ae42c0c22?sid=87a8b4f0" title="Loom video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>


NB: If you can't find the replit team for your program on Replit, this means that you have not joined the replit team yet! Join here <a href="https://replit.com/teams/join/xicwltqhixbewobhqignpuisvpkjmhqt-tk10-wf" target="_blank"> here </a>

3. Once your scribe has created a group, everyone needs to go and join that same group. Everyone should log in to <a href="https://replit.com"> Replit </a>, navigate to "teams", find "Try Kibo 10: Web Foundations", and find the group that your scribe just created.

**NB:** DO NOT create another group or join a different group erroneously! Ask your scribe for their replit name, and find it amongst the groups. See video demo on how to join the repl your scribe created below.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/dab58d8d41164e5abb40a6b46ed34036?sid=2690b26f" title="Loom video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Once all team members have joined the repl that your scribe created, you will discuss and write your program in your repl as a team.

4. Follow the instructions in the file `instructions.md`.

Work together as a team to add all the information below to your site:

- Your Squad name 
- One thing that everyone in the squad has in common
- Each squad must individually add their profile to the page. add:
  - First name and last initial (e.g., Mercy W, Osamudiamen O)
  - Photo
  - A one-sentence biography
  - Why you are learning Web Foundations

    
In the end, your site should look similar to <a href="https://squad-about-page-example.kibocurriculum.repl.co/" target="_blank" >**this example site** </a>

Once the Team Info Program is done, ensure all team members have a link to the website - you will all individually submit that link in the next challenge.

**Completion criteria:** Every squad member‚Äôs information is on the squad info bot/page and everyone has a link to the repl

## Challenge 3: Submitting the feedback form

**Description:** Submit the feedback form below indicating that you have completed the challenge. **You must submit the feedback form to receive credit for attending orientation.**

1. Each squad member should submit <a href="https://forms.gle/uHpwrsJ4zCvNSycQ9" target="_blank" >**this form** </a>

2. After each member has submitted the form above, your scribe should get the link to the website and share it in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/866676763450933258/936572023319195658" target="_blank"> #random </a>channel saying "Squad # has completed all the challenges."
