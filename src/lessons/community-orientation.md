## Challenge 3: Screenshots and URLs

> **Instructions:** Help each of your teammates share a screenshot and a URL in your squad channel.

When you ask for help on a coding assignment, you need to share information that
another student or an instructor can use to help you figure out what's going on.

Two of the best tools for sharing that are

* A screenshot of the code
* A URL of the assignment

Everyone in your squad should complete these steps individually:

1. Go to your version of the [Try It: Change the
   Color](https://replit.com/@kibocurriculum/Try-it-Change-The-Color) exercise
   in Replit. (If you haven't completed the replit, don't worry - this is about
   practicing asking for help in Discord)
2. Take a **screenshot** of your code. (See below for instructions for your
   platform)
3. In your squad channel, post a message with the url of your version of the code and the screenshot of your code.

Here‚Äôs how to take a screenshot on Windows, Mac, and Chromebook:
