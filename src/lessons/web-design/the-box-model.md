## Rectangles everywhere

CSS thinks in rectangles.

> Everything in CSS has a box around it.

> *[MDN Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)*

Everything on the screen in your browser ‚Äî even if it shows up as a circle,
triangle, or squiggle ‚Äî has a dedicated rectangle of space when browser figures
out where to put it on the screen.

### The Illustrated Box Model

Below is an illustration of the **Box Model**. Each element has margin, border, padding, and content.

If you know the Box Model, you can use CSS to control how much space the browser puts between the rectangles. It‚Äôs a key set of tools for you to use in making a page look good.

From the inside, going outwards:

- **Content** is what‚Äôs inside an element.
- **Padding** is the space between the element and the border.
- **Border** is a line around the element that can have some width.
- **Margin** is the space between elements.

These properties apply to the top, right, bottom, and left of the element.

## Box Model in the DevTools

Before you dive deeper into the box model, here‚Äôs a quick tutorial on how to view the box model in the DevTools.

<details>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/rw9w7rsyE1U" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
</details>

## Content

Content is what‚Äôs inside the element.

It doesn‚Äôt have a single CSS property that sets how big it is. Instead, it‚Äôs the sum of the sizes of all the stuff inside.

For some elements, you can set the `width` and `height` properties to control the dimensions, but this doesn‚Äôt always work.

![The content box](./the-box-model/content-box.png)

## Padding

Padding is the space between an element and its border.

It‚Äôs controlled by the `padding` properties:

- `padding-top`
- `padding-right`
- `padding-bottom`
- `padding-left`

You can set any of the properties on their own, or set them all at once with `padding`.

Check out the [MDN docs on padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) for an interactive example and more information.

![padding-box.png](./the-box-model/padding-box.png)

### `padding` example

The `padding` shorthand sets the top, right, bottom, and left in one line.

```css
/* top | right | bottom | left */
padding: 30px 12px 30px 12px;
```

![padding highlighted around a box](./the-box-model/padding-illustrated.png)

<details>
<summary><strong>Further Exploration: CSS direction shorthands</strong></summary>

These are all equivalent:

```css
/* top | right | bottom | left */
padding: 30px 12px 30px 12px;

/* top | right and left | bottom  */
padding: 30px 12px 30px;

/* top and bottom | right and left  */
padding: 30px 12px;
```

If you leave out some of the 4 values, they get ‚Äòfilled in‚Äô by the earlier value along the same axis.

If you use just 1 value, it applies to all 4 sides, so `padding: 1px` is the same as `padding: 1px 1px 1px 1px`.

The same shorthand works for the `border` and `margin` properties too.

</details>

## Border

Border is a line around an element, with a width, color, and style. It‚Äôs controlled by a set of `border` properties.

- `border-width`
- `border-color`
- `border-style`

These can each be set for the whole element, or for the top, right, bottom, or left, like `border-top-color` or `border-bottom-style`.

![border-box-model.png](./the-box-model/border-box-model.png)

### `border` example

The `border` shorthand sets the width, style, and color for all 4 sides.

```css
/* width | style | color */
border: 4px dashed green;
```

![Green dashed border](./the-box-model/border-illustrated.png)

See the [MDN docs on border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) for more information.

## Margin

Margin is the space between one element‚Äôs border and another element. It‚Äôs controlled by a set of `margin` properties.

- `margin-top`
- `margin-right`
- `margin-bottom`
- `margin-left`

Like the other box model properties, `margin` is a shorthand for setting all of the properties at once.

![the margin box](./the-box-model/margin-box.png)

### `margin` examples

`margin` is shown in yellow. It‚Äôs applied to the blue element.

```css
margin: 20px;
```

20 pixels of margin on all sides.

![margin on all sides](./the-box-model/margin-all-sides.png)

```css
margin: 20px 0;
```

20 pixels of top and bottom margin, 0 left and right margin.

![margin top and bottom](./the-box-model/margin-top-bottom.png)

```css
margin: 0;
```

0 margin on the top, bottom, left, and right.

## Further Reading: Box model for inline elements

<details>
<summary>The box model is different for inline elements</summary>

One thing that can be pretty confusing: the box model is true for most elements, but... some elements don‚Äôt actually work that way!

Elements like `<a>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` are **inline elements**. They don‚Äôt go onto a whole new line like a `<p>` or a `<div>`. Inline elements get a slightly different version of the box model than **block** elements.

Here are the differences for **inline boxes** (from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)):

- The box will not break onto a new line.
- The¬†`width`¬†and¬†`height`¬†properties will not apply.
- Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but *will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box*.

Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.

MDN‚Äôs [page on the Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) explains more about block and inline boxes.
