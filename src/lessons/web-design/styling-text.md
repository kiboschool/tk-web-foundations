# Styling text

Text is a big part of almost every webpage. If the text looks good, the page
will look good.

There’s a lot you can control about how text looks! Size, color, spacing, and
shape are only the first layer. There’s also niche text styles, like decoration
(e.g. <u>underline</u> or ~~strikethrough~~).

There's lots of other choices too! Body and header fonts, how links look when
you hover them, how the numbers or bullets look on your lists...

Choosing the right value for each property is hard. Each change you make forces
you to tweak something else. Over time, you’ll build an intuition for what
makes a site look good, and how to achieve good design with CSS. For now, we’ll
tell you what properties CSS can control, and the most important rules for good
typography.

In the next few lessons, you'll learn how to control those properties with CSS,
instead of with sliders.
