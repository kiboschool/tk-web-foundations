# What is web design?

Web design is all about what shows up on the page, and how it looks and behaves. 
All of these parts are connected - what HTML elements you choose is closely tied to how they look! 

What an element _does_ is connected to how it _feels_ to use it. For example, 
it's helpful to the user if a link looks changes color when they click it or hover over it with the
cursor.

Learning web design means learning what a good website or feature looks like,
_and_ how to actually make it happen in code. It's about both the _skills_ and
about _judgement_.

You won't become a master web designer in just a week. You will learn to
use CSS properties that determine the appearance of web pages, and you'll
start to develop your best judgement for seeing what makes a design good or bad.

## Noticing

Designing a site to look good starts with noticing what doesn‚Äôt look right. Then, 
you can make large or small changes to the design to fix it.

You‚Äôve already visited plenty of websites in your life, and you‚Äôve probably noticed that some sites look good, and others look bad. Now, you‚Äôll need to hone this skill to notice *why* you feel this way about some sites.

## Practice: Noticing

<aside>

üëÄ **[Can‚Äôt Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)** is a game to help you practice **noticing** designs that are right and wrong.

1. Go to [Can‚Äôt Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)
2. For each level, click on the better design
3. Try to get through at least all of the Easy levels.

**Once you are done playing, ask yourself the following questions**

- Were some design mistakes easier or harder to notice?
- Do you think you could spot the mistakes without the comparison image?

## What makes a site look good?

Everyone has different taste in design, so there‚Äôs no universal ‚Äúbest‚Äù styles. Even so, some sites seem better to more people or are easier to use. Usually, what makes sites look good is a combination of just a few characteristics:

- Text Styling
- Spacing
- Colors
- Box model
- Layout

CSS has tools for styling each of these. We‚Äôll focus on some of these in the
next few lessons.

If you want to read more about visual design, see 
[Clean Up Your Mess: A Guide to Visual Design For Everyone](https://www.visualmess.com/) (10 min).

It discusses what makes a design ‚Äúclean‚Äù and how to communicate what‚Äôs important. 
In particular, it focuses on how to use spacing, size, proximity, and alignment 
to create contrast and a visual hierarchy.
