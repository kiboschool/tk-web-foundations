# What is web design?

Web design is about all the choices you make about what shows up on the page,
and how it looks and behaves. All of these parts are interconnected - what
elements you choose is closely tied to how they look! What an element _does_ is
connected to how it should _feel_ to use it. For instance, it's really helpful
to the user if a link looks different when you tap it or hover over it with the
cursor.

Learning web design means learning both what a good site or feature looks like,
_and_ how to actually make it happen in code. It's about both the _skills_ and
about _judgement_.

You won't become a master web designer in just this week, but you'll learn to
control key properties that determine the appearance of web pages, and you'll
start to develop your eye for spotting what makes a design good or bad.

## Noticing

Getting a site to look good starts with noticing what doesn‚Äôt look right. Then, 
you can make large or small changes to the design to fix it.

You‚Äôve visited tons of websites in your life, and you‚Äôve noticed that some sites 
look good, and others look bad. Now, you‚Äôll need to hone this skill. You need to
learn to tell *why* some sites look good and others look bad.

## Practice: Noticing

<aside>

üëÄ **[Can‚Äôt Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)** is a game to help you practice **noticing** designs that are right and wrong.

1. Go to [Can‚Äôt Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)
2. For each level, click on the better design
3. Try to get through at least all of the Easy levels.

**Once you are done playing, consider the following reflection questions**

- Were some design mistakes easier or harder to notice?
- Do you think you could spot the mistakes without the comparison image?

## What makes a site look good?

Everyone has different taste, so there‚Äôs no universal ‚Äúbest‚Äù style. All the same, some sites look good and others don‚Äôt. Usually, what makes sites look good is a combination of just a few characteristics:

- Text Styling
- Spacing
- Colors
- Box model
- Layout

CSS has tools for styling each of these. We‚Äôll focus on some of these in the
next few lessons.

## Further Exploration

If you want to read more about visual design, see 
[Clean Up Your Mess: A Guide to Visual Design For Everyone](https://www.visualmess.com/) (10 min).

It discusses what makes a design ‚Äúclean‚Äù and how to communicate what‚Äôs important. 
In particular, it focuses on how to use spacing, size, proximity, and alignment 
to create contrast and a visual hierarchy.
