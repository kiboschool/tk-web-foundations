In previous lessons, you learned how HTML and CSS can be combined to build cool websites. This week, we'll shift focus to JavaScript, and how to make your site interactive.

JavaScript is a different kind of language than HTML and CSS. It's more like Python - it runs step by step, instead of representing things on the page (HTML) or selectors and styles to apply (CSS).

## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Use the console to experiment with JavaScript on a page
- Write JavaScript to make changes on the page in response to user actions
