Here's a recap on static and dynamic web pages.

- **Static** means it doesnâ€™t change â€” it shows the same way for different users at different times. Wikipedia is a good example of a web page, or lots of web pages.
- **Dynamic** means the site changes â€” it shows up differently for different users at different times, like Facebook or Gmail. It usually means it saves data that users enter.

Web Apps use the same building blocks as static websites. The tools in this course will help when you move on to building Web Apps in the future.
