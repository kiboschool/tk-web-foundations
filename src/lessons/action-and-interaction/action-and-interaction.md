# Action and Interaction

In week 3, you were introduced to Javascript, so you already know:

- How to link a Javascript file to our HTML file using the `script` tag, and  some other ways we can run a Javascript program.
- The basic Javascript arithmatic operators
- Variables and data types in Javascript
- How to write a basic program using conditionals, loops and functions.


In this week, you will apply this knowledge by adding event listeners to our HTML page.


## Learning Outcomes

After this week, you will be able to:

- Select HTML elements using query selectors
- Add listeners and call a function when an event occurs on our web page.
