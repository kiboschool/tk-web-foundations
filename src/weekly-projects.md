# Weekly Projects

Each week, you'll have a project to complete, either as an individual, or with
teammates. The projects will bring together the skills you learn that week.

This page will list all of the projects, so you have a convenient place to find them.

<!-- WEEKLY TODO: Uncomment the upcoming week's project -->

* [Week 1: CS Professor Page](lessons/foundations/project.md)
* [Week 2: Profile Page](lessons/web-design/project.md)
* [Week 3: Content Gallery](lessons/action-and-interaction/project.md)
* [Final Project](./final-project.md)

Note that there are no Weekly Projects in weeks 4 or 5, so that you have time to
work on your Final Project.

## Practice Exercises

Each week, there are activities in the lessons and practice exercises at the end
of the lesson. Learning Web Development takes lots of practice, so you should
try to complete as many of these activities as possible. They will not be
graded, and you will not get feedback on your work unless you reach out on
Discord or to the instructor directly for feedback.

You are encouraged to work with teammates on the practice problems.
