## What you'll learn

This course provides a foundation in building for the web. It will help you understand how the internet works, help you examine the role of the internet in your life, and teach you the basics of web development.

It will cover the building blocks of web technologies. You will learn HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript. The course will focus on collaboration, communication, and sharing. Web technology is fundamentally social; you will work together and build for real audiences.

The course culminates in a project where you'll create a website of your own design using the tools you learn throughout the course.

## Course Overview

* Week 1: Foundations
* Week 2: Web Design
* Week 3: Javascript Fundamentals

## How the course works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this course:

Active engagement is necessary for success in the course! You should try
building lots of websites, so that you can explore the concepts in a variety of ways.
