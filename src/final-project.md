# Final project

---

**In week 5 there are no new topics to learn.** So you‚Äôll focus on your final project, and then work on finishing up the work from the previous weeks and wrapping up the course.

<aside>

üë• **This is a team project**. You can work with teammates you‚Äôve worked with before, or find new teammates. There is a maximum of 3 teammates on a project.

Communicate with your teammates, then join the Replit team together and schedule time to work on the project.

Your team will have to agree on a project idea. If you have a firm idea of what
you want to build, make sure to tell your partners before you decide to join
the team together.

# Description

Your final project will be a website you design and create with a team.

You‚Äôve learned a ton about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. The final
project is your chance to build a website of your own design from scratch.

There are few requirements. You must use the knowledge you learned in the
course, as outlined in the rubric below.

## Topic and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide what your final project will be. The challenge is to choose a design that is exciting to you, but is not so big that it‚Äôs overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Here‚Äôs some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project you‚Äôll be able to complete.

- Your final project should be about as complicated as the most complicated exercises and projects you‚Äôve already done, or maybe a little bit more advanced.
- Don‚Äôt plan to learn a whole new technology for the final project. Plan to use mostly what you‚Äôve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the things you run into along the way).

### What features should you **include?**

- Different HTML elements
- Web Design (fonts, colors, layout)
- Interactivity (images, media, and maybe some JavaScript)

### What features should you **avoid**?

- Collecting data
- Forms
- Payment

We haven‚Äôt covered how to collect and save data from users. Don‚Äôt plan to build a banking app, a social media website, or an e-commerce site. For those to work, they need to save data from users, which we haven‚Äôt covered.

If you have an idea that you and your team really love, that depends on saving user data, try to come up with a version of the design that works without saving any user data. For instance, you could have a version of Youtube that only has a few videos, and doesn‚Äôt save comments or likes. Without those features, it‚Äôs not exactly like youtube, but it‚Äôs still pretty cool.

## How should you work together?

You‚Äôll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isn‚Äôt confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how you‚Äôll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when you‚Äôll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using Google docs or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work you‚Äôve done, and what work is left to do.
