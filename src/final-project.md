# Final project

---
**Due date: Friday, December 1**

**In week 5 there are no new topics to learn.** So you‚Äôll focus on your final project, and then work on finishing up the work from the previous weeks and wrapping up the course.

Congratulations on making it this far in your Try Kibo journey! It‚Äôs been a fun-filled few weeks. Now it‚Äôs time for you to put your skills to test by building a website of your own design. The final project is a chance to celebrate what you‚Äôve learned and explore the creativity of coding.üé®

üë• **This is a team project**. You can work with teammates you‚Äôve worked with before, or find new teammates. You should form a team with a maximum of 3 teammates to work on your project. 

Your team will have to agree on a project idea. If you have a firm idea of what you want to build, make sure to tell your partners before you decide to join the team together.

If you cannot or do not wish to work with a teammate, you may work on the project alone. If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the #help-web channel in Discord

# Description

Your final project will be a website you design and create with a team.

You‚Äôve learned a ton about HTML, CSS, and the web in this course. The final
project is your chance to build a website of your own design from scratch.

There are few requirements. You must use the knowledge you learned in the
course, as outlined in the rubric below.

## Topic and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide what your final project will be. The challenge is to choose a design that is exciting to you, but is not so big that it‚Äôs overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Here‚Äôs some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project you‚Äôll be able to complete.

- Your final project should be about as complicated as the most complicated exercises and projects you‚Äôve already done, or maybe a little bit more advanced.
- Don‚Äôt plan to learn a whole new technology for the final project. Plan to use mostly what you‚Äôve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the things you run into along the way).

### What features should you **include?**

- Different HTML elements
- Web Design (fonts, colors, layout)
- Interactivity (media elements)
- Publishing and Sharing
<!-- - Interactivity (images, media, and some JavaScript) -->

### What features should you **avoid**?

- Collecting data
- Forms
- Payment

We haven‚Äôt learned how to collect and save data from users. Don‚Äôt plan to build a banking app, a social media website, or an e-commerce site. For those to work, they need to save data from users, which is not taught in Web Foundations.

If you have an idea that your team really loves that depends on saving user data, try to come up with a version that works without saving any user data. For example, you could have a version of Youtube that only has a few videos, and doesn‚Äôt save comments or likes. Without those features, it‚Äôs not exactly like youtube, but it‚Äôs still pretty cool.

## How should you work together?

You should talk with your team about what works best for everyone. The best teams communicate clearly and often, so that there isn‚Äôt confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how you‚Äôll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and what times you‚Äôll meet to work on the project.

You should also create shared a **design doc** to write down your ideas. You can use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) or a text file in Replit. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that explains what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work you‚Äôve done, and what work is left to do.
