## Share gratitude

This experience has been better by the efforts of so many people, including your peers. Take a minute to write and read notes of gratitude:

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4;margin-top:30px;"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/k9lk72lhey17gkew" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>


## Keep coding

Remember that programming is a long journey and what matters is to learn well, not fast. And keep practicing!

- Finish the practice assignments from this course, if there are any that you didn‚Äôt get to during these five weeks.
- Practice more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our favorite resources for continuing to learn are
    - [Interneting Is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/)
    - [Shay Howe‚Äôs Learn HTML and CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
    - [FreeCodeCamp‚Äôs Responsive Web Design Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)
