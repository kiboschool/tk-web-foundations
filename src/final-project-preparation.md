Your final project (due on May 27th) will be a website you create with a team.

🏔️ **Final Project Description**

You’ve learned a ton about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. The final project is your chance to build a website of your own design from scratch.

Some project ideas:

- A website for a friend or family member’s business
- A field of study or topic that you are interested in
- A small game you can build in JavaScript

👥 The final project will be a team project. You can have up to three people on your team. You can work with teammates you’ve worked with before, or find new teammates.

If you have trouble finding a partner, use the **#help-web** channel in Discord to see who else needs a team. You can work with anyone, you are not restricted to your squad. You are allowed to work independently, but it’s good practice to work together.

Your team will have to agree on a project idea. If you have a firm idea of what you want to build, make sure to tell your partners before you decide to join the team together.

⛔ **Don’t start coding yet!**
This week, you are forming your team and planning what the site will have on it.

****You will not start coding on the final project until after you finish the work for week 4.

## Topic and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide what your final project will be. The challenge is to choose a design that is exciting to you, but is not so big that it’s overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Here’s some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project you’ll be able to complete.

- Your final project should be about as complicated as the most complicated exercises and projects you’ve already done, or maybe a little bit more advanced.
- Don’t plan to learn a whole new technology for the final project. Plan to use mostly what you’ve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the things you run into along the way).

### What features should you **include?**

- Different HTML elements
- Web Design (fonts, colors, layout)
- Interactivity (images, media, and maybe some JavaScript)

### What features should you **avoid**?

- Collecting data
- Forms
- Payment

We haven’t covered how to collect and save data from users. Don’t plan to build a banking app, a social media website, or an e-commerce. For those to work, they need to save data from users, which we haven’t learned how to do in this class.

If you have an idea that you and your team really love, that depends on saving user data, try to come up with a version of the design that works without saving any user data. For instance, you could have a version of Youtube that only has a few videos, and doesn’t save comments or likes. Without those features, it’s not exactly like youtube, but it’s still pretty cool.

## How should you work together?

You’ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isn’t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how you’ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when you’ll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a **design doc**. Using Google docs or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work you’ve done, and what work is left to do.
