# Select your live class time

You must attend live class once a week on Zoom. This is one of the most loved parts of the program! You get a chance to solve problems live, and learn with amazing instructors. **Please select the time that works for you below then click the link to register.** 

<aside>
📢 You should **only sign up for one class!** If you select a class and it says that “event is sold out”, that class has filled up and you should pick another one.

🗓️ Each class takes place on Thursday, and is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. The class dates are **Thursday April 28th**, **Thursday May 5th**, **Thursday May 12th**, and **Thursday May 19th**.

# Join Discord and Introduce Yourself!

Discord is our community platform. It's where you will get daily announcements, get help from instructors, attend office hours, and learn together with your classmates. Once the program starts, all communication from the Kibo team will be through Discord, so joining is mandatory. 

**Click here to join the Kibo School Discord server: [https://discord.gg/9Vqam4Ub](https://discord.gg/9Vqam4Ub)** and ****then follow the instructions to sign up. Once you have joined, update your Discord profile and introduce yourself to the community (**see details below on how to do both of these**).

### **Update your Discord Profile**

You can customize your profile by finding yourself in the member list, then selecting “Edit Server Profile.” For instructions, see the gif below.

1. Update your **name** to your first name and last name initial (e.g. Emmy O, Ope B)
2. Upload a profile photo.
3. In the About Me section, add a **description** with a sentence or two about who you are, or include a quote you like.

1. Your full name
2. The name/nickname that people typically call you
3.  Your location
4. A fun fact about you
5. An image or gif that represents you!

**TIP:** Post your text message first, then post your gif/image as a separate message afterwards.
